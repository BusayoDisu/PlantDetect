PROJECT TITLE:"Alberta Plant ID: Harnessing Machine Learning to Preserve and Explore Local Flora"
Welcome to my personal project.

Problem Statement
Despite the rich biodiversity of Alberta's native plants, accurately identifying and classifying these species remains a challenge, hindering conservation efforts and educational initiatives.

Solution
To address this issue, this project aims to develop a user-friendly app utilizing machine learning techniques to empower users to easily identify and classify Alberta's plant species with precision and efficiency
